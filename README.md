# Room Occupancy Detection

This project aims to detect room occupancy using sensor data and machine learning techniques. The model is trained on environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels to determine whether a room is occupied.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict room occupancy based on sensor data.
- **Dataset**: Contains sensor readings such as temperature, humidity, light, CO2, and humidity ratio.
- **Model**: Machine learning classification model to classify occupancy status.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
